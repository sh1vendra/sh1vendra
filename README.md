ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a sophomore at Texas State University, majoring in Computer Science.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m passionate about front-end development and love creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My skillset includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, and C++. I have a solid foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which allows me to design efficient algorithms and optimize the performance of the applications I develop.

ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m always pushing myself beyond my limits, working on personal projects to sharpen my skills and take on new challenges in web development. My focus is not just on making designs look good, but on ensuring they work seamlessly across devices for a smooth user experience.

ðŸŽ¯ I approach my development journey with a strong learnerâ€™s mindset, continuously striving to expand my expertise. Whether itâ€™s mastering new frameworks, refining best coding practices, or optimizing application performance, I am committed to improving my skills. Iâ€™m passionate about connecting with others who share a love for technology and problem-solving, and I thrive in collaborative environments that foster continuous learning and growth.

ðŸ“ª Feel free to reach out to me, whether itâ€™s to chat about code, collaborate on projects, or exchange ideas. You can contact me at shivendra@txstate.eduâ€”Iâ€™m always open to professional opportunities or even just a friendly conversation. Letâ€™s get connected!
